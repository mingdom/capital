# Dev Log â€” 2025-09-16

## Summary
- Replaced the separate `analyze`/`benchmarks` flow with a unified `performance` command that renders Rich tables for SavvyTrader, Fidelity, and (optionally) SPY/QQQ benchmarks.
- Extracted shared data gathering into `portfolio_cli/performance.py` and moved HTML report rendering to `portfolio_cli/report.py`; both the CLI `report` command and `scripts/build_report.py` now reuse these helpers.
- Added a CLI-driven `report` command that writes the consolidated HTML report, and modernized the script wrapper to match.
- Enhanced the interactive shell with tab completion updates, `report`, `reload`, and `ls` commands, along with automated tests for the new behaviors.
- Trimmed the README to a minimal quickstart and refreshed `.agent/cli-notes.md` with implementation details.

## Current State
- `performance` command shows 12-month tables + summary metrics for all sources and benchmarks.
- `report` command (and script) emits a simple HTML overview aligning with the CLI output.
- Interactive shell supports manual reloads and mirrors the CLI feature set; unit tests cover completions, reload alias, and HTML generation.

## Next Ideas
- Allow users to specify custom benchmark tickers (`--benchmark AAPL --benchmark ^NDX`) fed through the same performance pipeline.
- Add optional chart visualizations (e.g., Plotly or Chart.js) to the HTML report for cumulative performance and drawdown.
- Persist shell history and configuration under `~/.config/portfolio_cli/` to retain commonly used commands between sessions.
- Introduce a `report open`/`performance export` flow to highlight differences (CSV export for metrics) for downstream analysis.
